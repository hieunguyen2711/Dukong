## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Dukong
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Copy the example environment file and add your SendGrid API key:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Edit `.env.local` and add your SendGrid API key:

   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_sendgrid_api_key_here
   ```

   **Get a SendGrid API Key:**
   - Sign up at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com)
   - Go to Settings > API Keys
   - Create a new API key with "Mail Send" permissions
   - The API key must start with "SG." for proper validation

4. **Generate student data from CSV files**

   ```bash
   node scripts/precombine.js
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## SendGrid Email Integration

### What it Does

The system includes a sophisticated email alert system powered by **SendGrid** that helps academic advisors proactively support students who are at risk of not graduating on time.

### Key Features

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Intelligent At-Risk Detection**
The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to identify students who may be at risk of not graduating on time:

- **Credit Analysis**: Compares completed credits vs. time remaining
- **Semester Constraints**: Considers realistic course load limits (15 credits/semester max)
- **Timeline Assessment**: Evaluates if remaining credits can be completed by graduation date
- **Early Warning System**: Identifies problems before they become critical

#### ðŸ“§ **Professional Email Communications**
- **Rich HTML Emails**: Beautiful, professional email templates with student progress details
- **Personalized Content**: Each email includes the student's specific academic information
- **Progress Dashboard**: Visual representation of completed, in-progress, and planned credits
- **Action Items**: Clear next steps and advisor contact information

#### ðŸ”„ **Automated Workflows**
- **Individual Alerts**: Send meeting requests to specific at-risk students
- **Bulk Communications**: Send alerts to all at-risk students simultaneously
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant email delivery with error handling and retry logic

### How the At-Risk Algorithm Works

The system evaluates multiple factors to determine if a student is at risk:

1. **Time Remaining Analysis**
   ```
   Semesters Remaining = (Graduation Year - Current Year) Ã— 2
   ```

2. **Credit Feasibility Check**
   ```
   Credits Still Needed = 120 - (Completed + In Progress)
   Max Possible Credits = Semesters Remaining Ã— 15
   ```

3. **Risk Categories**
   - **Critical Risk**: Impossible to complete even with maximum course load
   - **High Risk**: Requires more than typical course load (>12 credits/semester)
   - **Moderate Risk**: Behind expected progress for their timeline
   - **On Track**: Meeting or exceeding expected progress

### Email Content Features

Each automated email includes:

- **Student Progress Summary**: Current credit status and completion percentage
- **Graduation Timeline**: Expected graduation date and time remaining
- **Meeting Request**: Professional invitation to schedule an advising appointment
- **Contact Information**: Advisor details and office location
- **Direct Links**: Link to student's four-year plan for detailed review
